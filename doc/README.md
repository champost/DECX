## Please *bear* with me!
I am doing my utmost to get the documentation out on time. 

But being 34yrs old (with 2 kids at home) in a precarious position (2nd postdoc) and having a `weak` [publication record](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=mu1kn1EAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) doesn't make it any easier for me to attain my altruistic worldview...

Though, you are more than welcome to speed up the process by collaborating with me on the development of DECX!
